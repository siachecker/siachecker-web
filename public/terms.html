            <p>
            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement
            between you (“you”, “your”, “Customer”) and <strong>SIA Checker</strong>
            (“SIA Checker”, “we”, “us”, “our”) governing your access to and use of the
            SIA Checker application programming interface and related services
            (the “Service”).
            </p>

            <p>
            By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have read,
            understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to
            these Terms, you must not use the Service.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
            <p>
            SIA Checker provides an automated API service that performs checks of UK
            Security Industry Authority (“SIA”) licence numbers by retrieving,
            processing, and presenting data obtained from the public SIA Register of
            Licence Holders and related publicly accessible sources.
            </p>
            <p>
            SIA Checker is an independent service and is not affiliated with,
            endorsed by, or operated by the Security Industry Authority or any UK
            government body.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Service may utilise caching, retries, and other technical mechanisms
            to improve performance and availability. Results may therefore reflect
            recently retrieved or cached data rather than live upstream responses.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Eligibility and Authority</h2>
            <p>
            You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use the Service. If you
            are using the Service on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you
            represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity
            to these Terms.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Access, API Keys, and Security</h2>
            <p>
            Access to the Service is provided via API keys issued by SIA Checker.
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security
            of your API keys and for all activity carried out using them.
            </p>
            <p>
            You must not share, sell, sublicense, or otherwise distribute API keys
            to third parties. SIA Checker reserves the right to rotate, suspend, or
            revoke API keys at any time for security, compliance, or operational
            reasons.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Circumvent or attempt to bypass rate limits, quotas, or technical safeguards</li>
            <li>Scrape, reverse engineer, or interfere with the Service or its infrastructure</li>
            <li>Use the Service in a misleading manner or present results as official SIA data</li>
            <li>Resell or redistribute the Service without prior written consent</li>
            <li>Use the Service in violation of applicable laws or regulations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            SIA Checker may suspend or terminate access if it reasonably believes
            these obligations have been breached.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Accuracy, No Warranty, and Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
            The Service relies on third-party public data sources over which
            SIA Checker has no control. As a result, SIA Checker does not warrant
            that the information provided by the Service is accurate, complete,
            current, or error-free.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties
            of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to
            implied warranties of accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, or
            non-infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Service is provided for informational purposes only and does not
            constitute legal advice, regulatory certification, or official
            verification. You remain solely responsible for verifying licence
            status and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Availability and Service Changes</h2>
            <p>
            SIA Checker does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation
            of the Service. Temporary unavailability may occur due to maintenance,
            upstream outages, or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
            </p>
            <p>
            We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the
            Service at any time without liability.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Fees, Billing, and Payments</h2>
            <p>
            Paid access to the Service is billed in advance on a monthly
            subscription basis through our payment processor, Stripe. Fees are
            non-refundable, including for unused quota, partial usage, or periods
            of unavailability.
            </p>
            <p>
            Usage is subject to the limits of your selected plan. Unused quota does
            not roll over to subsequent billing periods. Taxes, including VAT where
            applicable, may be added at checkout.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Suspension and Termination</h2>
            <p>
            SIA Checker may suspend or terminate your access to the Service
            immediately if payment fails, abuse is detected, or continued access
            would pose legal, security, or operational risk.
            </p>
            <p>
            You may stop using the Service at any time. Termination does not
            relieve you of any outstanding payment obligations.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
            All rights, title, and interest in the Service, including software,
            documentation, and branding, remain the exclusive property of
            SIA Checker. These Terms grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
            non-transferable right to use the Service during the term of your
            subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
            No rights are granted to underlying source code, systems, or proprietary
            technology.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, SIA Checker shall not be liable
            for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages,
            including loss of profits, revenue, business opportunities, or
            compliance failures.
            </p>
            <p>
            SIA Checker’s total liability arising out of or relating to the Service
            shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to SIA Checker in the
            twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SIA Checker from and against
            any claims, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your misuse of
            the Service, violation of these Terms, or reliance on Service results.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the
            Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the
            updated Terms. The “Last updated” date will indicate when changes were
            made.
            </p>
        </section>

            These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
            of England and Wales, and the courts of England and Wales shall have
            exclusive jurisdiction.
